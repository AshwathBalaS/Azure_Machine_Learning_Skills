# Azure_Machine_Learning_Skills

1. **Basic Azure Components:** Resource Group, Virtual Machine, Disk, Application Insights, Log Analytics

2. **Azure Storage:** Blob (Blob Service --> Containers --> Blobs), File Service --> Files, Queue Service --> Queues, Table Service --> Tables,ADLS Gen 2 (Built on Top of Azure Blob Storage - Blob Storage + Hierarchical Namespace (HNS)), Azure SQL Database

Main Types - Containers, File Shares, Queues, Tables

3. **Azure ML Studio:**

(i) Authoring: Notebooks, AutoML, Designer, PromptFlow

(ii) Assets: Data, Jobs, Components, Pipelines, Environments, Models, EndPoints

4. **Azure ML Studio:** Data Stores - Connects to Azure Storage Services, 

5. **Data Preprocessing:** Missing Values - "Clean Missing Data" Action (Can be Replaced with Mean, Median or Mode); Outliers - "ClipPeaks" Action (Can handle ClipPeaks, ClipSubpeaks or ClipPeaksandSubPeaks) (Can use Constant or Thresholds) (We use Substitute Value for Peaks, Overwrite 

## Machine Learning Notes from the Course:

**A) Data Preprocessing Techniques such as Log Transformation, Polynomial Features and Feature Interaction are important**

**B) Feature Selection:**

**1. Filter Methods: Correlation Analysis, Mutual Information, Chi-Squared Test**

**2. Wrapper Methods: Forward Selection, Backward Elimination, Recursive Feature Elimination**

**3. Embedded Methods: Lasso Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Assign Zero Weights to less important features**
